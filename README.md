Here's a simple explanation of the code step by step:

Importing Libraries: The app uses streamlit for the interface and pandas for handling data.

Title & Info: It sets a title "Machine Learning App" and a brief description.

Data: The app loads and displays a penguin dataset from a URL. It separates the data into features (X_raw) and labels (y_raw).

Data Visualization: A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between bill length and body mass, color-coded by species.

Sidebar Inputs: Users provide input features like island, bill size, and body mass through sliders and dropdowns.

Input Data: User inputs are combined into a dataframe.

Data Preparation: Categorical columns like island and sex are encoded, and labels (y) are transformed into numerical values.

Displaying Data: The encoded input features and labels are shown in an expandable section for user reference.

The app is setting up for a machine learning model based on user inputs and encoded data.

packages used

Streamlit: A simple Python framework for building interactive data apps.

Numpy: Essential for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation with DataFrames.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for models and algorithms.
